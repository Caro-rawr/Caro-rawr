# 🌿 Hi, I’m Caro 

I’m a sustainability researcher working at the intersection of **territorial decarbonization**, **socio-environmental transitions**, and **decision-making under deep uncertainty**.
Trained as a **biologist**, and currently pursuing a **Master’s in Sustainability Sciences at UNAM** and a **Bachelor’s in International Relations**, I bring a **transdisciplinary perspective** to navigate complex systems where **climate, territory, justice, and governance** converge.
My work integrates **geospatial modeling**, **data analysis**, and **participatory processes** to support the development of multi-scale strategies aligned with national and global sustainability goals. I focus on how **science, policy, and collective action** interact to shape just and resilient futures — particularly across Latin America.

## 🧬 About me

I started out as a molecular biologist, deeply fascinated by cellular biology and the invisible architectures of life. But life has brought me elsewhere — toward the messy, fascinating world of climate change, sustainability, and environmental policy.
I’m passionate about addressing climate and ecological challenges through public policy, and I’m drawn to international affairs and the idea of helping shape the world through global cooperation.
I love **learning how to transform data, models, and participatory tools into operational strategies** that support just, grounded climate action.
